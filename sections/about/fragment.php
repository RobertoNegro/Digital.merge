				<p>This entire website is made by <span class="bold pinktext">Roberto Negro</span>, a computer science student of the University of Trento. The name is a simple recall to a typical code where Digital is an object in a programming language and merge() is a function of that object. So, if you're confused: Yes, it's only a nerd thing to indicate that we have to merge the digital gender division!<br/>
				I hope that this little thing will help someone to understand the real importance of computer science (or at least to create some interest in the topic), and maybe to make you think about that bad gender gap that has no sense to exist. If you are a girl that want to join in a school where you're going to study computer science, do it! There's no reason to skip that experience only for those fears and stereotypes! And if you're not but you know someone that is in that position, please send her this link and help her to understand that diversity is strength and there no reason to be scared.</p>
