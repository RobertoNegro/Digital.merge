        Why usage is so balanced and development not? And why it can be a real problem? Those are two of the many questions that a wide problem like that can produce. Answering the first question, as we can presume there are a lot of causes, but one of the most important ones is: <span class="bold yellowtext">stereotypes</span>. Stereotypes are all around when we talk about gender differences and <i>women/men doing that thing</i>. It's not only a problem in ICT but it spreads in all the other contexts where a specific gender is predominating on the other. It's not easy to compensate, but in the last years we've got some <span class="bold">big improvements</span> over this aspect. But while we're going, slowly but surely, to beat the wrong ideology that the gender should be a remarkable thing to look when we're hiring someone, there is still a stereotype about <span class="bold yellowtext">what ICT is</span>. And, answering to the second question, this is a serious problem: with a really small number of women playing a role in digital development, we're going to create services, software and devices that are made by men and, unconsciously, <span class="bold">for men</span>.
