				<p>«<i><span class="pinktext bold">Computer science</span> is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. [...] A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. <span class="pinktext bold">Computation</span> is any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps.</i>» (Wikipedia)</p>
				<p>So, basically, as many may have told you, <span class="bold">math</span> is a fundamental intellectual tool in computing. You may think that it isn't true if you use your computer only for browsing or sending emails (or even if you're a beginner in coding), but when you start studying and working on computer science, a good knowledge of math and logic is a requirement.<br/>
				But, don't worry, it's not all about programming! Like any other science, computer science is a <span class="bold">wide subject</span>. There are a lot of things that an computer scientist could do: make websites, manipulate big sets of data, produce algorithms to predict things, resolve complex mathematical problems with custom applications, make some cool dynamic graphical things (like some of the backgrounds of this website!), setup and configure networks, automate a long and boring process in an one-click procedure, etc. </p>
				<p>It really doesn't make sense that "<i>computers are for men</i>", there are a lot of examples of women computer scientists that have made big things: just to say some clamorous examples, the first computer programmer in the world was <span class="bold">Ada Lovelace</span> (1815-52) and the first compiler for a programming language was made by <span class="bold">Grace Hopper</span> (1906-1992). And looking at our days, the founder of Ubisoft Toronto (ever played Assassin's Creed?) is <span class="bold">Jade Raymond</span>.</p>
				<p>Just because actually there are more men creating new software than women, it's obvious that for a boy studying computer science is more attractive because he can find more specific applications and games made by man and so (unconditionally) more biased to the interests of the men. We need more balance to gain more <span class="pinktext bold">variety</span>, <span class="pinktext bold">versatility</span> and boost our <span class="pinktext bold">creativity</span> one step over. We have to improve computer science education to fix the ideas about what is computer science, and why it's important.</p>

				<p>And yes, when someone studies computer science it'll learn how operative system works so he probably can fix your laptop if it doesn't start.<br/>
				And he'll learn how to create a program, so he could make his own game.<br/>
