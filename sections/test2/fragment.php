		  			You'll stay a lot of time looking at your monitor for sure, but if you use technologies making attention to health (take a break every hour, etc) you won't have any problems!

		  			There are a lot of other things inside computer science! That doesn't mean that there must be something you like, but please don't think that software development is the only thing that a computer scientist do!

		  				My greatest aspiration would be to become a youtuber then
		  			</label>
		  		</div>
		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			A youtuber is just someone that make videos on youtube, there isn't correlation from an computer scientist to a youtuber. Just because youtube is based on technologies that you'll study in computer science that doesn't mean that using youtube requires any knowledge!

		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			You'll learn how to develop software, so yes you'll learn how to make games too, but don't think that computer science is just only that!

		  			Remember: IT isn't only for men! Saying something like that it's like say that chemistry is only for men: there's no reason to think something like that! 
						It's a science, like many others, that use a lot of logic, theoretical knowledge and math. That's it!
						So don't be embarrassed, because like you there are a lot more girls that want to join computer science courses but they're only scared. Move forward, all together, and then you won't be alone!

		  		<div class="test_answer_desc correct">
		  			Yes, that's correct. Actually there are a lot of situations where technology takes place thanks to its automations and speed: understanding how to use it and know how to manipulate it will help you in a lot of circumstances for sure!
