		  			It's ok if you don't like or you don't have interest on computer science, but it's not only "computers". Computer science look at every digital device, in a lot of different sections, software, connection, etc. Maybe you don't need a computer, but you might need a smartphone, tablet or so.. And, as you can image, computer science concern those too!

		  				It's not important.. Excel, Word and PowerPoint aren't as useful as they taught us at school in real life!
		  			</label>

		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			Excel, Word and PowerPoint are softwares made by Microsoft for calculations, writing and presentations. They're only three specific applications that you might or not need. At school they usually teach you how to use them because when they cover the major probability of usual usage. That doesn't mean that you'll need any of those, but maybe knowing something about other softwares can help you in your things.. Don't understimate computer science only for those three examples!

		  				It's nice to know how to write "hello world" in a console, but that's not so useful
		  			</label>
		  		</div>
		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			The first application that at school they tend to teach is the classic "Hello Word". That's only a start, just to teach how to get an output from our application. Obviously it's only an example to show the most basic thing that an application can do, think at every application you have on your smartphone or computer, they're born all from some type of enormous code!

		  		<div class="test_answer_desc correct">
		  			Yes, as you can see with your own eyes, computers are everywhere and know how they works can help you a lot, in every environment!

		  				I think it's quite important because when computers get stuck we need the help of a technician!

		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			Computer science it's not only about repairing things, but it's more about creating and managing them. When you study IT you'll learn how an operative system works, so this can help you to understand problems in a computer. But if you study (a lot of) computer science, one day you'll learn how to CREATE an operative system, not only fix them!

		  				It's important, i can't live without videogames!
		  			</label>
		  		</div>
		  		<div class="test_answer_desc wrong">
		  			You'll learn how to create your own videogames, but that's only a very small part of what you can learn from computer science! And no, you won't play videogames at school
